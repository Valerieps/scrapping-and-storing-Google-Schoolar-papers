# scrapping-and-storing-Google-Schoolar-papers
To help managing scientific contributions at LBD Machine Learning laboratory


This project aims to build a database to store scientific material produced and published by LBD, a machine learning and databases laboratory at UFMG - Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.

In order to add the material that's already published, I'm working on a crawler to capture papers metadata from the professor's Google Schoolar's profile. The databse will be implemented in MySQL

The goal of the database is to quickly retrieve important information regarding the lab's productivity, contributions network of co-authorship, most researched keywords and so on.
